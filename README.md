# DSF2Blender
Python script for Blender that allows import of X-Plane DSF files

This code is very basic and has currently very limited function. However in it restricted context it seem to work.

WARNING: However, this code is under development and could cause issues.

In order to use read the comments in the Python script, understand restrictions and follow instructions.
Then copy the script in the text editor and run it. And hopefully it shows you the mesh of the full dsf 1x1 grid.
